# Gender Variance
## Adults
### Female to Male
#### Pharmacotherapy
Purpose: relief of dysphoria, physical virilisation

- Testosterone

- Prevent menstruation: IUS, POP, implant, GnRH analogue
- Require contraception

#### Screening
Need to ensure patient is referred for cervical screening, breast screening

### Male to Female
#### Pharmacotherapy
- Oestradiol
- Testosterone Blockade (GnRH analogue or alternative antiandrogen)

#### Screening
- Prostate and PSA
- Mammography (hormonal treatment increased breast cancer risk)


### Bridging Prescriptions
Definition: Monitoring and prescribing pharmacotherapy whilst patient awaits services of a GIC (Gender Identity Clinic)

Doctor's should act within their competence: refer to GIC, monitor mental health

GMC has [specific guidelines](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#Mental%20health%20and%20bridging%20prescriptions) related to this:

> But you should only consider issuing a bridging prescription in cases where all the following criteria are met:
> 
> -   the patient is already self-prescribing or seems highly likely to self-prescribe from an unregulated source (over the internet or otherwise on the black market)
> -   the bridging prescription is intended to mitigate a risk of self-harm or suicide, and
> -   the doctor has sought the advice of an experienced gender specialist* and prescribes the lowest acceptable dose in the circumstances.

The BMA has [guidelines](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/equality-and-diversity-guidance/lgbtplus-equality-in-medicine/inclusive-care-of-trans-and-non-binary-patients) and a [letter](https://www.bma.org.uk/media/1086/bma-letter-to-gmc-specialist-prescribing-may-2016.pdf) to the GMC
