# Shoulder

## Definitions

- Rotator Cuff Disease - tendinopathy or tear of >= 1 of the 4 rotator cuff muscles, or subacromial bursitis - the most common cause of shoulder pain presenting to physicians
- Subacromial Impingement Syndrome - clinical entity characterised by a 'painful arc' of shoulder abduction between 60 and 120 degrees; can be caused by rotator cuff disease

## Anatomy

- supraspinatus muscle initiates abduction
- infraspinatus initiates external rotation
- teres minor initiates external rotation and some adduction
- subscapularis initiates adduction and internal rotation

## Differential

- referred pain from the c-spine
- osteoarthritis
- adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)

## Clinical Presentation

- Dull pain which becomes sharp and throbbing with overhead activities
- Localised in the deltoid muscle
- Night pain, weakness, stiffness, crepitus
- Muscle atrophy on examination

- Pain on passive movement suggests adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) or glenohumeral arthritis

## Prognosis

- Most improve with conservative, non-operative management
- Large tears can progress and become irreparable
