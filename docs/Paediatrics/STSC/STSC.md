# Spotting The Sick Child (STSC)

This section is a work-in-progress, writing notes from the _Spotting the Sick Child_ (STSC) [online course *](https://spottingthesickchild.com/)

## The 3 minute toolkit

ABCDENTTT

**A _– Airway_** – Is it obstructed?

- eg secretions, foreign body, stridor
- unprotected airway - tolerance of OP airway?

**B – _Breathing_** – Is the child struggling to breathe?

- Assess respiratory rate, look for recession/accessory muscle use, check oxygen saturation, auscultate the chest
- Auscultation - wheeze (asthma), crepitations (bronchiolitis), bronchial breathing
- SpO2 < 94% imply significant illness

**C – _Circulation_** – Is there evidence of poor circulation?

- Assess colour skin, heart rate, capillary refill time (on sternum and fingers/toes), blood pressure, warm or cold hands/feet?
- Pallor, mottling (hypoperfusion)
- Cold peripheries and delayed CRT (> 2 seconds) imply peripheral vasoconstriction(ie sepsis, dehydration)
- Peripheral CRT is more sensitive to early hypoperfusion than central CRT, but is also affected by cold environment
- Children maintain a normal BP until very unwell due to effective peripheral vasoconstriction

**D – _Disability_** – What is the child’s neurological state?

- Assess pupil response to light, limb tone and movement, AVPU score/GCS, irritable (unconsolable)
- Pupils
  - Sluggish pupils - drug overdose or post-ictal
  - Changing sizes - ongoing seizures
  - Asymmetry - space occupying lesion
  - Abnormal gaze following seizure

**E – _Exposure_** – Have you exposed the child and examined top-to-toe?

- Rashes – viral rash, infectious disease rash, non-blanching rash (septicaemia?)
- Any evidence of injury/trauma
- Bruises – Always think **Non-accidental injury** in the non-mobile child
- Use any safeguarding skills you have learnt on accredited courses in child protection to identify any marks on the skin, or how a child is kept, or their interaction with the parent(s)/guardian(s).

**ENT – _Ears, Nose and Throat_**  
Mandatory in any febrile child
Pink ear drums, and large red tonsils are seen in most febrile children and are non-specific for otitis media or tonsillitis

**T – _Temperature_** 
-  Use a tympanic or axillary (infant) thermometer.
- You may require a rectal thermometer in the very unwell child

**T – _Tummy_** – Is this soft? Distended? Tender? What are the bowel sounds like? Any masses? Any hernias? Tenderness, peritonism, masses? Distractible pain?

- In boys, never forget to examine the testis (testicular torsion = surgical emergency)
- Urinalysis

**D E F G – Don’t Ever Forget Glucose!** 3 - 5 mmol/l
